// Package plugin is the seam between vllm-helper's own commands and the
// integrations that mirror local state into somebody else's system -- Coder
// Agents today, potentially OpenWebUI or a local agent config later.
//
// A plugin owns three things: whatever configuration it needs, the commands
// it contributes to the CLI, and the lifecycle events it wants to hear about.
// Core never enumerates a plugin's config keys or hardcodes its command name,
// so adding one is a matter of writing it and registering it.
//
// Two rules the Coder integration established, which every plugin inherits:
// an unconfigured plugin is skipped rather than being an error (these are all
// optional), and a plugin that fails must not fail the local operation that
// triggered it. Switching models has to work on a laptop with no network.
