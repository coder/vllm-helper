description: When the endpoint is down, or the service is crash-looping.

Run `vllm-helper doctor` first.
It checks the build toolchain vLLM needs, inventories running servers, verifies your Coder and HuggingFace credentials against their APIs, and warns when config has drifted from reality.
With `--yes` it installs missing toolchain packages without asking.

## The endpoint isn't responding

`vllm-helper status` prints the right command for your platform when the endpoint isn't responding, and says which of two very different things is happening: the service is still loading, or it is failing to start.
A large model can take many minutes to load, so the two look identical from the outside.

For crash loops, read the actual traceback:

```sh
journalctl -u vllm.service -n 100                          # Linux
tail -n 100 ~/Library/Logs/vllm-helper/com.coder.vllm.log  # macOS, user scope
tail -n 100 /Library/Logs/vllm-helper/com.coder.vllm.log   # macOS, system scope
```

`vllm-helper logs` follows the same log — Ctrl+C to stop watching, the service keeps running.
`--no-follow` prints the last lines and exits, and `-n` sets how many.

## The first switch takes forever

A first `switch` or `new` downloads the weights, which can keep the boot log on screen for a long time.
Ctrl+C there only stops watching; the server keeps loading in the background, and `vllm-helper status` tells you when it's up.
Use `--no-follow` to skip the wait entirely.

## vLLM refuses to start

On a machine whose memory is shared with the OS, vllm-helper lowers `--gpu-memory-utilization` to what the machine can actually spare and logs the change.
On vLLM's CPU backend, on Linux or macOS, that is the memory free right then.
If even that does not fit because only a sliver of memory was free, it says so and suggests closing some apps and switching again.

On a Mac serving through vllm-metal, the value is left as it is.
vllm-metal checks for memory pressure at startup and sizes its KV cache to fit.
To give it more room, raise the GPU's wired memory limit with `vllm-helper metal-limit`; see [Running on macOS](./macos.md).

## It started outside vllm-helper

If `status` or `doctor` reports a server that config doesn't account for — a different model serving on the configured port, or a unit vllm-helper doesn't manage — run `vllm-helper adopt` to save its live command line as a profile and take over future switches.
It does not restart or interrupt anything.
