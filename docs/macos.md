title: Running on macOS
description: Serving on the Apple Silicon GPU through vllm-metal, and what it changes.
---

On Apple Silicon, vllm-helper serves on the GPU through [vllm-metal](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-metal), a vLLM plugin that runs models with MLX and Metal.
It needs macOS 15 or later on an Apple Silicon Mac.
When vllm-metal is not installed beside `VLLM_BIN`, vLLM's CPU backend still works as a fallback; see [CPU backend](#cpu-backend).

## Install vllm-metal

Install the stable release with Homebrew:

```sh
brew tap vllm-project/vllm-metal https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-metal
brew install vllm-project/vllm-metal/vllm-metal
```

To try a development build instead, run the install script.
It creates a venv at `~/.venv-vllm-metal`:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vllm-project/vllm-metal/main/install.sh | bash
```

`pip install vllm-metal` is not a supported way to install it.
The [vllm-metal docs](https://docs.vllm.ai/projects/vllm-metal/en/latest/) cover what each release supports.

## Run setup

1. Run `vllm-helper setup`.

Setup looks for `vllm` on your PATH first.
If it is not there, it tries where the two installers put it: `/opt/homebrew/opt/vllm-metal/libexec/bin/vllm`, then `~/.venv-vllm-metal/bin/vllm`.
A Homebrew install is recorded by its `opt` path rather than the versioned Cellar path, so `brew upgrade` does not leave `VLLM_BIN` pointing at nothing.

Setup then asks the Python beside `VLLM_BIN` whether vllm-metal is installed, and asks MLX how much memory the GPU may use.
When both answer, setup says so:

```text
Apple M5 Ultra (unified memory), serving on the GPU through vllm-metal (239 GB Metal working set)
```

`vllm-helper doctor` shows the same on its `backend:` line.
On the CPU backend, that line says so and suggests installing vllm-metal.

## Pick an MLX model

vllm-metal loads MLX checkpoints, usually from [mlx-community](https://huggingface.co/mlx-community) on Hugging Face:

```sh
vllm-helper new mlx-community/Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct-8bit
```

On an M5 Ultra under a system-scope LaunchDaemon, that model serves at about 85 tokens/sec for a single stream.
Its card has no `vllm serve` snippet, so `vllm-helper new` adds no flags.
For tool calls, set the parser by hand:

```sh
vllm-helper set qwen3-coder-30b-a3b-instruct-8bit -- EXTRA_ARGS="--enable-auto-tool-choice --tool-call-parser qwen3_coder"
```

Which models run follows vllm-metal's [supported models](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-metal/blob/main/docs/supported_models.md) list, not vLLM's.
Quantizations made for CUDA, such as FP8 block or NVFP4, do not run.
The architecture has to be supported by vllm-metal as well.
For example, DeepSeek-V4-Flash does not run on vllm-metal 0.32: stock mlx-lm has no model for it, and vllm-metal's paged attention does not handle its compressed sparse attention.

## What is different

- **`GPU_MEMORY_UTILIZATION` is a share of the Metal working set.**
  The working set is how much unified memory macOS lets the GPU use, and macOS already keeps it below installed RAM.
  New profiles default to `0.9` here.
  vllm-metal allocates the KV cache as it goes and checks for memory pressure at startup, so `vllm-helper start` leaves the value as it is.
- **The memory budget comes from the working set.**
  It is 90% of the working set, minus about 2 GiB for vllm-metal itself and room for a KV cache.
  A 256 GiB M5 Ultra gets a weights budget of about 194 GB.
  If MLX cannot be asked, the working set is estimated at 75% of RAM, and the budget's reason says it is an estimate.
- **`doctor` skips the build toolchain.**
  vllm-metal ships prebuilt wheels and Metal kernels, so there is nothing to compile.
- **Logs are a file, not a journal.**
  The launchd job writes to a log file; see [Logs](#logs).

## Run on a headless Mac

By default the service is a LaunchAgent in `~/Library/LaunchAgents`, so controlling it needs no root.
A LaunchAgent needs a GUI login session.
Over SSH on a Mac nobody is logged in to, loading it fails with launchd error 125, and vllm-helper says why.

On a headless or server Mac, run it as a LaunchDaemon instead:

1. Set `SERVICE_SCOPE=system` in `~/.config/vllm-helper/config.env`.
2. Run `vllm-helper setup` again.

That installs `/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.coder.vllm.plist`.
It starts at boot and runs as the user who installed it, so it reads that user's config and model cache.
`vllm-helper status` and `doctor` read its state without sudo.
Starting, stopping, restarting, and switching it need sudo, as system scope does on Linux.

## Give the GPU more memory

macOS caps how much unified memory the GPU may wire, and that cap is the working set.
`vllm-helper metal-limit` shows the RAM, the current `iogpu.wired_limit_mb` (`0` is the macOS default), the working set that results, and a suggested limit.
The suggestion leaves 16 GiB for macOS on a Mac with 128 GiB or more, and 8 GiB on a smaller one.

```sh
vllm-helper metal-limit              # what it is now, and a suggestion
vllm-helper metal-limit --set auto   # apply the suggestion, or pass a size in MiB
vllm-helper restart                  # vllm-metal reads the working set at startup
vllm-helper metal-limit --reset      # back to the macOS default
```

`--set` writes `METAL_WIRED_LIMIT_MB` to `config.env` and applies the limit now with sudo.
The setting does not survive a reboot, so it also installs a LaunchDaemon, `com.coder.vllm-helper.wired-limit`, that applies it again at every boot.
Whenever the live limit differs from `METAL_WIRED_LIMIT_MB`, `vllm-helper start` waits up to 60 seconds for it to match before it starts vLLM, then warns and starts anyway.
`--reset` removes that daemon and sets the limit back to `0`.
`doctor` shows the current limit and suggests raising it.
`metal-limit` needs macOS 15 or later on Apple Silicon, the same as vllm-metal.

After a raise, the ceiling vLLM may touch grows on the next restart, because `GPU_MEMORY_UTILIZATION` is a share of the working set.
`KV_CACHE_MEMORY_BYTES` does not grow: each profile keeps the cache size it was planned with against the old working set.
Planning again only changes a cache that was cut short to fit; one that already holds `KV_CONTEXT_TARGET` full contexts comes out the same.
To use the extra room in the cache, either:

- Set the size yourself: `vllm-helper set <profile> KV_CACHE_MEMORY_BYTES=<bytes>`.
- Plan the profile again: `vllm-helper new <repo>` reuses a profile that already exists, so remove it first with `vllm-helper remove <profile>`. The active profile cannot be removed, so switch to another one first.

A higher limit gives the GPU more of the RAM and leaves less headroom for macOS.
That is a good trade on a dedicated server, and a worse one on a desktop you also work on.

## Logs

The launchd job writes to `<label>.log`, which is `com.coder.vllm.log` by default:

- User scope: `~/Library/Logs/vllm-helper/com.coder.vllm.log`
- System scope: `/Library/Logs/vllm-helper/com.coder.vllm.log`

`vllm-helper logs` follows whichever one the service uses.

## CPU backend

Without vllm-metal beside `VLLM_BIN`, vLLM runs models on the CPU through its experimental CPU backend.
It is useful for small models and development, not for serving anything large.
A 0.6B model in BF16 serves at roughly 30 tokens/sec on an M4 Pro.

There are no Apple Silicon wheels for the CPU backend, so it has to be built from source:

```sh
brew install cmake ninja
uv venv --python 3.12 ~/venvs/vllm
git clone https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm.git ~/vllm-src && cd ~/vllm-src
VIRTUAL_ENV=~/venvs/vllm uv pip install -r requirements/cpu.txt --index-strategy unsafe-best-match
VIRTUAL_ENV=~/venvs/vllm VLLM_TARGET_DEVICE=cpu uv pip install -e . --index-strategy unsafe-best-match
```

Then run `vllm-helper setup` and point `VLLM_BIN` at `~/venvs/vllm/bin/vllm`.

On the CPU backend:

- **Quantized weights don't work.**
  It handles FP32, FP16, and BF16, so pick a model small enough to run unquantized.
- **`GPU_MEMORY_UTILIZATION` means system RAM.**
  It reserves a fraction of total RAM, and vLLM refuses to start unless that much is free right then.
  Profiles default to `0.3`, and `vllm-helper start` lowers it further when the machine is busy, logging the change.
- **`doctor` checks the build toolchain.**
  It looks for cmake, ninja, and the Command Line Tools, and with `--yes` installs what Homebrew can.

## Next steps

- [Memory budget](./memory.md): what decides whether a model fits, and how to override it.
