title: Install and upgrade
description: Install the binary, configure the machine, and keep it current.

llm-helper ships as a single binary for Linux amd64 and arm64 and for macOS arm64.
It manages an existing inference server install; it does not install one itself.
On Linux that means an NVIDIA GPU and a vLLM usually living in a venv; on macOS it means a source build of vLLM's CPU backend, see [Running on macOS](./macos.md), or mlx-lm, see [Providers](./providers.md).

## Install

1. Download the latest [release](https://github.com/coder/vllm-helper/releases) for your platform.
2. Unpack it and install the binary:

   ```sh
   tar xzf llm-helper_*.tar.gz
   sudo install llm-helper /usr/local/bin/
   sudo ln -sf llm-helper /usr/local/bin/vllm-helper
   ```

   The archive also carries the same binary as `vllm-helper`, its old name, for installs from before the rename. Some messages still print that name, so the link keeps them working.

3. Run `llm-helper setup`, or `llm-helper setup --provider mlx` to serve with mlx-lm.

If `vllm` isn't on your PATH, set `VLLM_BIN` in `~/.config/vllm-helper/config.env` to its full path.

## What setup writes

`setup` writes two files under `~/.config/vllm-helper/`:

- **config.env** — settings that apply to every profile, sourced into the server's environment on every switch.
- **secrets.env** — credentials, generated or filled in by you. Never commit this file anywhere.

## Upgrade

```sh
llm-helper upgrade --check          # what's available, without installing
llm-helper upgrade                  # replace this binary
llm-helper upgrade --channel dev    # follow main instead of releases
```

There are two channels.
`stable` is the tagged releases.
`dev` is rebuilt from `main` on every commit that passes CI, so it carries work that hasn't been released yet — useful for trying a fix before it ships.
The channel you pass is remembered, so later `llm-helper upgrade` runs stay on it; switch back with `--channel stable`.

Upgrading replaces the binary only.
A running server was started by the old one and keeps serving until `llm-helper restart`.
If the binary lives somewhere only root can write, run the upgrade with `sudo`.

While this repository is private, reading releases needs a token: set `GITHUB_TOKEN` in the environment or in `config.env`.

Run `llm-helper version` to see what is running.
On the dev channel every build shares one moving release tag, so the commit is what tells two builds apart.

## Upgrading from vllm-helper

llm-helper is vllm-helper under a new name, and an upgrade from vllm-helper changes nothing on disk.
`vllm-helper upgrade` replaces the binary where it is, and the old name keeps working: config and state stay in `~/.config/vllm-helper` and `~/.local/state/vllm-helper`, the `VLLM_HELPER_*` overrides are read as before, and the service is still `vllm.service` or `com.coder.vllm`, running the same path.
To type the new name as well, link it beside the old one:

```sh
sudo ln -s vllm-helper "$(dirname "$(command -v vllm-helper)")/llm-helper"
```
